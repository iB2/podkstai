        'It's a valid concern. I think the key will be transparency. Making sure patients understand how their data is used. Otherwise—it could create a huge disconnect.\\n'

        'That's a great question. I guess the real challenge will be ensuring that technology complements—rather than complicates—these vital interactions.\\n'
